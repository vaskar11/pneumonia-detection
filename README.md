# Pneumonia Detection Model
This repository contains a deep learning model designed to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Built on a Kaggle notebook, this project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images as either pneumonic or normal, contributing towards faster diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia.
## Project Overview
Pneumonia is a severe respiratory infection that affects millions worldwide. Early detection via X-ray imaging can significantly improve patient outcomes. This model provides a binary classification of chest X-ray images, identifying if a given X-ray shows signs of pneumonia.

## Dataset
The model was trained and evaluated on the Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle, which contains images categorized into two classes:
- Pneumonia
- Normal

## Data Preprocessing
Basic image preprocessing steps include resizing, normalization, and data augmentation (such as rotations and flips) to improve the model's robustness.

## Model Architecture
The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the following key layers:

- Convolutional layers for feature extraction
- Pooling layers to reduce dimensionality
- Fully connected layers for classification
Optionally add specific model details if a particular architecture like VGG16, ResNet, or a custom CNN was used.

## Installation
To run this model locally, youâ€™ll need Python and the following libraries:

- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Keras (if using TensorFlow)
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (for image processing)
